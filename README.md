# NEA-2020
The AQA NEA 2020 for Year 11

The situation for this years NEA was creating a program that helped a new airline company calculate the likely profitability of running a
flight between a UK airport and an overseas airport.

The code extracts data from a csv file and uses said data to calculate things like flight cost, flight income, flight cost per seat etc.

This was made using the python programming language
